# MVC Framework!

 - [DEMO video](https://streamable.com/47w300)
 - [Commits log](https://github.com/MartinN94/mvc-framework/commits/master)


# Installation

 - Clone the repository
 - Import the database
 - Open project and go in app/config
 - Enter your credentials
 - Vendor is uploaded because composer is used only for autoloading

## NOTE: The app is developed in LEMP Stack enviromet with pre-configured Laravel Valet. I've added .htacces files for Apache, but they are not tested yet. In other enviroments you might have to use URLROOT form config files in hrefs and in form actions


# Challenge approach
1. Creating MVC structure
2. Configuring .htacces files to forbid access to app folder and redirect everything through public/index.php
3. Creating the Core of the framework (app/libraries)
4. Creating helpers
5. Creating autoloader
6. Creating User MVC structure
7. Creating User Model and Controller logic
8. Creating User Views and styling them
